Building online guidebook and information hub for backcountry skiers

This project started as a motivation to improve upon existing resources such as Powder Project, OnX Backcountry, or OpenSnow.
All of these sites are good at some things but fall short in many other areas. As a backcountry skier, I find myself spending
hours researching a new zone looking at where to even go, trip reports, route beta, weather, avy conditions, the list goes on. 
My goal is to create a single website that combines all the best resources I've come to find most useful over the years and 
have it be a one-stop site when planning an outing, saving a lot of time and browser memory usage without 20 tabs open haha. 

So far the main crux has been learning actual CSS and building a responsive website. As well as figuring out what data I can use on
the site without copyright issues. Still very motivated but haven't been working on it as much with college classes and work.
Hopefully, over the summer I will have more time to work on it.
